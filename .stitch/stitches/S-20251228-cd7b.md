## Intent

Add `current` as a special value for `stitch show <id>` to show the current stitch without needing to know its ID.

## Changes

- Added `requireCurrentId()` method to `StitchClient` in `src/api.ts`
- Updated `stitch show` command to resolve "current" to the current stitch ID
- Updated help text to document the `current` shorthand

## Usage

```bash
stitch show current    # Show the current stitch
stitch show S-xxx      # Show a specific stitch by ID
```
